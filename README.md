RaidEssentials
==============

This was a plugin for Bukkit back in 1.7 of the full release of Minecraft. 

It was originally being developed by myself and later with another developer but this was scrapped as the server itself was cancelled before completition. 

A few classes shown here have little to no functionality because they were never expanded upon, however the Global Exchange, Weapon Generating API and Currency system along with issuing commands in chat all function correctly - these were never tested much and could potentially raise errors. 

This project is only on here to show work that I have been a part of and work that I had recently contributed too. This project is not complete, but others are welcome to learn and use my code as long as I am credited for what is used.
